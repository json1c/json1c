### Hi there 👋

#### I specialize in backend development and infrastructure engineering. I design and maintain  high-load services, build Telegram ecosystems, and work extensively with Rust, Python, distributed  systems, database optimization, and DevOps workflows.

#### I’m highly focused on production quality: monitoring and metrics, performance profiling, fault-tolerant architecture, efficient queueing systems, caching strategies, and overall resource optimization. I enjoy building systems that remain fast, stable, and predictable under heavy load.
